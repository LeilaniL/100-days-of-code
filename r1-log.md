# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Leilani Leach

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Tues June 29, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1 
[Vanilla JavaScript version of Space Invaders](https://github.com/LeilaniL/space-invaders) for Recurse Center challenge. Realizing I haven't tried to make a game in forever and I of course underestimated the complexity. Had to think about how to structure and position grid of enemies, and aiming for more JavaScript vs. CSS animations.

### R1D2
[Vanilla JavaScript version of Space Invaders](https://github.com/LeilaniL/space-invaders) for Recurse Center challenge. Replaced images w/ emojis since I need to stick to 1 file. Got rows of enemies to move to side correctly but bug has them appearing only to move down -- yet when breakpoints added you can see they _are_ still moving to the side.

### R1D3
Fixed bug + finished required features for mini space invaders game. Had fun working with keydown events for moving the character + figuring out how to style the form input to not look like a form input and behave properly: autofocus attribute, value = emoji, matched color of text to background so the caret is still there but you don't see it at least. [Vanilla JavaScript version of Space Invaders](https://github.com/LeilaniL/space-invaders) for Recurse Center challenge.

### R1D4
Fine-tuned some styling and things like making sure the player icon doesn't move offscreen. Found out different browsers set different padding/margin/border defaults. [Vanilla JavaScript version of Space Invaders](https://github.com/LeilaniL/space-invaders) for Recurse Center challenge.

### R1D5
Completed [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) and started CodePen layout challenge to practice some more: [https://codepen.io/LeilaniL/pen/zYwvjOg?editors=1100](https://codepen.io/LeilaniL/pen/zYwvjOg?editors=1100)

### R1D6
Used CSS Grid for menu layout challenge: [https://github.com/LeilaniL/grid-practice](https://github.com/LeilaniL/grid-practice) It still needs some work but more for image sizing. Reading up on CSS attributes that take comma-separated values, nth-child selectors (there are even and odd keywords!), etc. because I was hoping to make a flag for the 4th. Found cool examples: [Vexillum](https://github.com/talgautb/vexillum) | [Pixelastic Flags of the World](https://github.com/pixelastic/css-flags)

### R1D7
Basically skipped today, too indecisive on what to work on. Updating to-do list to have clearer goals.

### R1D8
Worked on a [timer app](https://github.com/LeilaniL/react-tdd-pomodoro-timer) to practice TDD with React + Jest. Toptal tutorial: [https://www.toptal.com/react/tdd-react-user-stories-to-development](https://www.toptal.com/react/tdd-react-user-stories-to-development)

### R1D9
Reviewed [space invaders game](https://github.com/LeilaniL/space-invaders) for Recurse Center pair programming interview. 

### R1D10
Had pair programming interview discussing space invaders, code readability, etc.
